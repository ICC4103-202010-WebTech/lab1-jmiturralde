Every article is within a table row, this can be accomplished by using the "tr" tag, in which data is inserted with the "td" tag, creating a perfectly order line in the website. The reason why you con then click on the title of the article and follow his url is because they use an "a href=.." tag.

*4.- Briefly describe what you see in files with names starting with hn.js and news.css. How are
these files different? What is their purpose?*

The hn.js document has all the function that let the page run free. For example, the comments functions allow as to see all of the comments of the corresponding article by calling the “Document.getElementsByClassName(), that returns an object similar to an array that has all of the names of the indicated class. 
By the other hand, the news.css gives all the visual style of the page. Giving for example what type of typography to use or what font size to be use for the different text in the page.
